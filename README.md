umuttopalak: resimler kaydırabilir bir widget'ta üst üste binmeden gözüksün

GitHub Copilot: To ensure that the images are displayed in a scrollable widget without overlapping, you need to adjust the layout and size hints properly. Here is a step-by-step plan:

1. **Ensure the [`GridLayout`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22GridLayout%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A32%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") is properly configured**: The [`GridLayout`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22GridLayout%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A32%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") should have a fixed number of columns and should adjust its height based on the number of images.
2. **Set the [`size_hint_y`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22size_hint_y%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A53%2C%22character%22%3A79%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") of the [`GridLayout`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22GridLayout%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A32%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") to [`None`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22None%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A36%2C%22character%22%3A29%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition")**: This allows the [`GridLayout`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22GridLayout%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A32%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") to grow vertically as more images are added.
3. **Bind the [`minimum_height`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22minimum_height%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A54%2C%22character%22%3A29%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") of the [`GridLayout`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22GridLayout%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A32%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") to its [`height`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22height%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A63%2C%22character%22%3A70%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition")**: This ensures the [`GridLayout`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22GridLayout%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fumuttopalak%2Fprojects%2Fbase64-image-saver%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A32%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") expands to fit all its children.
4. **Ensure each image container has a fixed height**: This prevents overlapping.
